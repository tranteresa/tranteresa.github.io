                        <h1>Trust is an inevitable experience</h1>
                        <p>
                            Have you ever sat down and thought about what Trust is? Or about what it takes to earn your Trust? Consider this one:</p>
                        <quote>What situations do not involve trust?</quote>

                        <p>The answer may not be easily defined or articulated, as it is dynamic and often "just a feeling you get." However, its presence is inevitable. Trust is a conversation that will always be present as long as humans exist to have feelings. </p>
                        <p>Trust is involved in virtually everything, whether we're conscious of it or not. And design is no exception.</p>

                        <p>Design a skill-trading community online platform from scratch. </p>
                        <p>How might we build an environment for others to exchange skills and knowledge online without money? How might we use Time and Skills as a resource? </p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div>

                        <p>Full ownership of UX and Product. I was responsible for managing and owning this project solo from scratch all the way to testing the clickable prototype. This included scoping, research, analysis, strategy, requirements, vision, branding, product, wireframing, testing, and more.</p>
                    </div>

                    <header>
                        <h5>Scope</h5>
                        <p>Bartery started off as a product idea. However, Trust became central to its creation after scoping and initial research.</p>
                    </header>
                    
                    <!-- Sifting through uncertainty -->
                    <div>
                        <h1>Sifting through uncertainty of viability</h1>
                        <p>Bartery started off as a product idea: An online community for people to exchange skills and knowledge via video chat sessions. Time and skills would be the main currency instead of money.</p>
                        
                        <p>But before building it out, I had to find out:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How useful would this product be?</li>
                            <li>To whom would it be useful?</li>
                            <li>Why would it be useful to them? What purpose does it serve?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>To answer these questions, I designed and conducted surveys and interviews with potential users.</p>
                        
                        <!-- The verdict -->
                        <div>
                        <h2>The verdict</h2>
                        <p>All users expressed interest in the concept and potential. Some wanted more context (i.e., a tangible application to try out) before forming a concrete opinion about how useful it would be to them. The main purposes it would serve users were for personal growth, lifelong learning, and the potential to save money. </p>

                        <p>Of course, the concept wasn't without its concerns. A significant one popped up with an interview participant: </p>

                        <quote>
                            What if I feel like I have nothing to offer, but still want to use the service? <span class="person">&mdash; Mike, interviewee</span>
                        </quote>

                        <p>Some were more interested in learning, not teaching, which might have something to do with how Mike felt.</p>

                        <p>The questions piled on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How might we help users feel like they have something to contribute?</li>
                            <li>Will exchanges be a flat (i.e., minute for minute), or will users have the chance to negotiate?</li>
                            <li>What does negotiation involve?</li>
                            <li>How will users select a person to trade with?</li>
                            <li>How might we help users in during that selection process?</li>
                            <li>How might we account for people who only want to learn?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But then, it dawned on me.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h1>The multi-layers of trust were central</h1>
                        <p>Aha! Everything led back to one theme: Trust. People won't feel confident and will likely leave  if trust is lacking. </p>
                        <p>Through my work, I discovered that trust online is a multi-layered interaction. It must be established in three ways:</p>
                        
                        <img src="assets/Bartery/images/trust-layers.png">
                        
                        <!-- 1. Trust for product -->

                            <h2>1. Trust for the product</h2>
                            <p>The product must be consistent and reliable. If anything goes wrong during a trade, user must have confidence that the company will be able to provide fair and sufficient solutions. In other words, user has to feel like itâ€™s got their back.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <!-- 2. Trust for potential trader-->
                        <div>
                            <h2>2. Trust for a potential trader</h2>
                            <p>People will not invest their resources in something or someone they do not trust. So, how do we set both parties up for success?</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <!-- 3. Trust in oneself -->

                            <h2>3. Trust in oneself</h2>
                            <p>If people donâ€™t feel confident they have anything to offer for the trade, they are likely to give up on it. This could mean encouraging users to think outside the box to show them they probably do have something to give!</p>

                        <p>To further this exploration and understanding of Trust, I conducted Competitive Analysis (which also included Usability Tests and Card Sorting) and Phone Interviews.</p>

                        <h1>Seeking competitors</h1>
                        <p>In order to gain a better, and quicker, understanding of the problem, I dug around for existing similar products to analyze.</p>
                        <p>Products were chosen based on the following elements:</p>
                        <ul class="checkbox">
                            <li>

                            <li>

                                Involve an element of learning and passing on knowledge.</li>

                        </ul>


                        <p>
                            I found various sites like
                            <a href="https://skilltrade.org/">SkillTrade</a>, <a href="https://tradegig.com/">TradeGig</a>, and <a href="http://cronnection.com/">Cronnection</a>. I also observed products that were specific to language exchanges, like LRNGO and iTalki. I learned from products that didn't meet all my requirements, such as YouTube. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I used the products to observe and analyze user reviews, user flows, features, branding, trends, and more. It was an opportunity to understand the where, what, why, and how people might be using the product. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, only one product came close to functionality and similarity to my product idea: <a href="https://timerepublik.com/">TimeRepublik</a>.

                            <p>Since TimeRepublik was the only fully operating product, I decided to test its usability with potential users. I recruited and met in person with research participants who have never used TimeRepublik before, and had them go through a few tasks:</p>

                                    If users are already frustrated this early on in their interaction with a product, they are more likely to give up on it. This feedback was incredibly useful in understanding what could affect conversion rates.

                            <h2>Cardsorting method</h2>
                            <p>To see how users trust, I looked at how they might form decisions around interacting with other traders. After each usability test, participants were given several Card Sorts that would allow me to observe different points of interactions a user might have with another trader.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Potential points of interaction:</h3>
                            <ol class="bottom-margin">
                                <li>Searching and browsing for a potential trader.</li>
                                <li>Narrowing down a list of potential traders.</li>
                                <li>Looking at a potential trader's profile.</li>
                                <li>Reading reviews about a potential trader.</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>From this, I created four different card sort categories: </p>
                            <img class="" src="assets/Bartery/images/cardsort-categories.JPG">
                            <ol>
                                <li>the search pageâ€™s Filter bar â€” to observe what might be initially important to users' when browsing and narrowing.</li>
                                <li>the search pageâ€™s Sorting options â€” to observe how users might prioritize.</li>
                                <li>another traderâ€™s Profile Page, and â€” to observe how a users' confidence and trust is built.</li>
                                <li>types of reviews on another user â€” to observe what further details are important to a user.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Each category above consisted of pre-made cards for participants to prioritize, as well as blank ones to include their own ideas. The categories were presented in the order shown above to mimic a realistic user flow to be used later on. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I found that conducting this after the usability test primed participants to quickly understand the context of the card sort, therefore avoiding unnecessary wasted time, confusion, and fatigue.

                            <p>First, figure out the information architecture of the most pertinent information. Paper and sticky notes were used &mdash; color coded, of course. </p>

                        <p>
                            I focused on the first user type, The Seeker, and their flow of seeking a Provider to meet their needs and completing a Trade Request with a Provider. The Providerâ€™s user flow, stories, and needs were still considered during the process due to the fact that interactions are a two-way street.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Initial user flow</h2>
                        <div class="rows">
                            <div class="six columns no-bottom-margin">
                                <h3>The Seeker</h3>

                        <p>Despite the already seemingly simplistic user flow and focus, as I continued, I noticed that things could be simplified even further in a way that would benefit the experience. This realization came when I remembered an important principle from my research: </p>
                        <quote>How might we help users make decisions as easy and quickly as possible? </quote>
                        <p>Users can get all the information they need about a person without taking the extra step to go to their profile. They can get enough information about that person on the same page as the service offer. </p>

                        <h2>Problem spot 2: search results cards</h2>
                        <p>The second spot users in which users wanted more clarity were in the cards of the search results page. </p>
                        <p>At first, they were formatted like this:</p>
                        
                        <div class="">
                            <div class="six columns small-bottom-margin">

                            </div>

                                <p>The biggest downfall to this module &mdash; aside from the  jumpsuit this model is sporting &mdash; is that it doesn't cater to human's visually-inclined behavior. Eyes naturally fall on the image first before attempting to gather additional information. But with this layout, users  spend more time and effort darting their eyes around. </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                To aleviate this issue, I shifted the design to prioritize image first, and then focused on an <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">F-Shaped pattern for reading</a> for the remaning content. This resulted in a brainstorm of potential iterations: 
                            </p>
                            <img class="" src="assets/Bartery/images/iterate-searchcards-many.png">
                            <p>I consulted a senior mentor for feedback. We kicked out the ones where ratings and details were not bound by a box like the rest of the information and were left with the following three:

                            <img class="bottom-margin" src="assets/Bartery/images/iterate-searchcards-abtest.png">
                            <p>From here, Preference Testing was performed, and users overwhelmingly chose choice C, followed by choice B, and lastly choice A.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Design better surveys and improve participant recruitment.</li>
                            <li>Implement how to build confidence in those who donâ€™t know what they have to offer. Such as: Helpful onboarding, ideas and examples (even quirky ones) clearly shown on homepage, or in suggestions.</li>
                            <li>Develop a system of earning trust points, samaritan levels, and time.</li>
                            <li>Design Userâ€™s profile page, implement what we know about how trust is involved.</li>
                            <li>Work out the Provider's user stories and flows.</li>
                            <li>Develop to Hi-Fi prototype.</li>
                            <li>Develop Branding.</li>

                        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                        <p>This is not, by any means, the end. The topic of designing for Trust will live on, because it is at the core of our very basic human needs â€” right next to others, such as love and connection.</p>
